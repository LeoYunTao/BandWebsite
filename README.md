# BandWebsite
This is a fictional band website created for ID assignment 1 project

## Deisgn Process
Before I begin wireframing the website, I looked for multiple inspirations on the internet for idea on how to design a band website.

I also thought about the diffent stakeholder's goal:
- As a Fan, I want to go to their website, so that book concert, buy merch, listen to some of their music and learn more about their history
- As a Other Band, I want to contact them to collaberate with them in the future
- As a musician, I want to contact them to join their band
- As a Site Owner, I want to get more traffic to the website, so that more users can buy our merch and book for concerts, so that I can generate more revenue
- As a SEO Engineer, I want to make the website as search engine optimized as possible, so that the ranking of the website will be higher on all the search engine and get more users
- As a Web Deigner, I want to design the website with good UI & UX, so that the website is easy to navigate and not lose user due to poor design
- As a Front-end Web Developer, I want to create website almost exactly like the deisgn while making it compatable and respoinsive to all the browser and differnet screen size, so that it can reach more users
- As a Front-end Web Developer, I want to optimize the website as much as possible, so that users will not leave due to the long waiting time
